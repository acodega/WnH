####Slides and content from my JNUC 2015 talk, Computer Deployment: Ask “Why?” not “How?”
**Tuesday, October 13, 1:30PM, Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis, MN**

YouTube video coming soon

**Description**

If you're new to the Casper Suite, or doing your yearly reevaluation of your toolset, you'll be thinking about computer deployment. With many different deployment tools, options, and workflows it can be hard to decide which one is right for your organization or project. In this session, Adam Codega will use his experiences joining a fast growing startup two years ago to explore the pros and cons of common deployment strategies and answer not just "How?" but "Why?" when choosing a deployment method.

**About the Presenter**

Adam Codega has worked in IT for four years as a consultant and then systems administrator before becoming a full-time Mac admin almost two years ago. At Swipely, a SaaS startup in Providence, RI, he embraces the new Apple IT Model and utilizes MDM, DEP, and VPP to keep his Mac infrastructure running. Like others, he also manages the service desk, IT security, and Wi-Fi, so Adam prefers to let computers do the hard work.
